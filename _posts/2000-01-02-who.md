Hey folks! I'm *St. John* ([pronounced SinJin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John_(name))). For the past 20 years or so, I've been spending quality time with my friends playing games at LAN parties!

Whether they were 24 hours long or just till midnight, I loved hanging out with friends, gaming, and drinking some quality Mountain Dew (hence the gamer tag CaffeineJunkie).

Even after I graduated, got a job, got married, had kids, I still love to game. So to this day, I continue to help organize and fund LAN parties at my office with my friends and co-workers.

Gaming and LAN parties are such an important part of my life and have helped me grow into the person I am today. So this year I'm dedicating time daily to play games and raise money for [UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital](https://www.ucsfbenioffchildrens.org/).

Come watch the stream.
